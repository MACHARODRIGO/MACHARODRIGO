## 🧬 GenomeGym – Bioinformatics Challenges 🏋️

💡 Train your bioinformatics skills with exercises that go from “warm-up” to “heavy training” in sequence analysis, data processing, and genomics.

### 🔰 Beginner
1. **[Dataset exploration](https://github.com/MACHARODRIGO/bioinfo-dataset-exploration)** – Load and explore a biological dataset with `pandas`.
2. **[DNA Sequences QC](https://github.com/MACHARODRIGO/02-dna-qc-genomegym-beginner)** – Perform **data quality checks** (duplicate IDs, empty values, invalid characters) and clean DNA sequences using `pandas` and `regex`. Produces a curated file ready for downstream analysis.
3. **[GC Scanner](https://github.com/MACHARODRIGO/03-GC-Scanner-FASTA-composition-profiling-genomegym-beginner)** – A small, reproducible exercise that uses `Biopython` to handle and process biological sequences in FASTA format, `pandas` to organize the data into tables, and `matplotlib` to create summary plots. It combines multiple FASTA files, computes nucleotide counts and GC content, and exports tidy CSV tables and QC plots.
4. **[Protein-Ligand Analysis](https://github.com/MACHARODRIGO/04-protein-ligand-genomegym-beginner)** – Learn how to load proteins from the Protein Data Bank using `gemmi`, represent ligands from SMILES with `RDKit`, and compute basic properties (molecular formula, molecular weight). Includes a Jupyter notebook with step-by-step examples.

### ⚙️ Intermediate
*(Coming soon)*

### 🚀 Advanced
1. **[tRNASec Structural & Sequence Exploration](https://github.com/MACHARODRIGO/tRNASec-Study-Project)** –  
   A complete research workflow exploring the **Selenocysteinyl tRNA (tRNASec)** family.  
   - 📂 Curated datasets from **RNAcentral**, enriched with structural/functional annotations (Rfam, MODOMICS, GtRNAdb).  
   - 🔬 Bioinformatics analysis: multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees, and secondary structure predictions with **ViennaRNA** and related tools.  
   - 🧩 Structural exploration: comparative analysis of canonical vs. non-canonical nucleotides, including 2D/3D motifs.  
   - 🤖 Machine learning: clustering and baseline classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, MLP) on sequence/structural features.  
   - 📊 Reproducible **Jupyter Notebooks** and modular **Python scripts**, with clear documentation and results.  

*(Coming soon – more advanced challenges!)*
